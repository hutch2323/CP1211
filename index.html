                    <p>The <strong>Toronto Blue Jays</strong> are a professional baseball team, and are a member of Major League Baseball. 
                    The Blue Jays are based out of <em>Toronto, ON</em>, but are currently playing in <em>Buffalo, NY</em>, due to the ongoing
                    COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this season, the Blue Jays played out of their spring training complex in <em>Dunedin, FL</em>.
                    It is believed that the Blue Jays will play games in Toronto as well this season, but that decision is in the hands of
                    the federal government of Canada.

                    <h2>Springer to resume training on Thursday</h2>
                    
                    <p>The Blue Jays received wonderful news recently, as it was announced that prized off-season acquisition, <strong>George Springer</strong>
                        will resume training in hopes of returning to the line-up soon. Springer, of course, signed a massive six-year,
                        $150-million dollar contract in January, serving as the largest contract in team history. However, Springer has only
                        appeared in 4 regular season games, picking up 2 HRs and 3 RBIs in the process.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">Many had hoped that Springer would finally be the piece that would push the Blue Jays into playoff contention, perhaps even picking up an American League
                        East crown in the process. Signing the 2017 World Series MVP was a top priority for Blue Jays management, building on the four-year, $80-million dollar contract
                        given to starting pitcher <strong>Hyun Jin Ryu</strong> (see <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ryuhy01.shtml">Career Stats</a>) last off-season. If Springer can return to full form, expect the Blue Jays to be a force on the diamond
                        this summer and fall. Here's a look at Springer's career stats:

                    <p>Since joining the Blue Jays in 2019, <strong>Vladimir Guerrero Jr.</strong> has quickly become a fan favorite in Toronto. Born in <em>Montreal, QC</em> to Hall of Famer <strong>Vladimir Guerrero Sr</strong>,
                        Vlad Jr. has carved a unique path for himself. Known for his ability to make contact and hit home runs, fans have started to gravitate towards Vladdy's happy-go-lucky attitude, which is 
                        evident by the video shown below:

                    <p>This season, Vlad Jr. has been on an absolute tear, batting to a .307 average with 8 HR and 26 RBI through 36 games. Many believe that this could be the breakout
                        season that we've all been hoping for from the 22 year old. To complement his bat, Vlad Jr. has also played stellar defence, often putting his own body on the line
                        to make remarkable catches or to bail out his teammates on errors.
